\## 🧠 Why Use This? (The Research Advantage)



When doing deep research, you often end up with 20+ tabs open. Returning to them later can be confusing—you forget \*why\* you opened a specific page or what specific paragraph was important.



\*\*"Why Am I Here?" solves this by letting you:\*\*



\* \*\*📍 Pinpoint Knowledge:\*\* Mark exactly what piece of knowledge a tab holds (e.g., \*"This tab has the definition of Habeas Corpus,"\* or \*"Paragraph 3 proves my argument about dowry laws"\*).

\* \*\*⏸️ Resume Instantly:\*\* Carry on your work exactly where you left off. Instead of re-reading a whole page to remember its relevance, just check your note.

\* \*\*📂 Organize Context:\*\* Treat every tab like a labeled file folder rather than a random window.



\## 🚀 Features



\* \*\*📝 Context Notes:\*\* Add a quick note to any tab to remember why you are there.

\* \*\*🔒 Privacy First:\*\* 100% Local Storage. No tracking, no analytics, no cloud sync.

\* \*\*⚡ Quick Access:\*\* Use `Ctrl + Shift + E` (or `Cmd + Shift + E`) to open instantly.

\* \*\*💾 Auto-Save:\*\* Notes are saved automatically as you type.

\* \*\*🛡️ Crash Recovery:\*\* Notes are backed up locally in case your browser crashes.

\* \*\*📊 Dashboard:\*\* View all your active notes in one place ("All Tabs" view).

\* \*\*🌙 Dark Mode Ready:\*\* Built with CSS variables for future theming.
